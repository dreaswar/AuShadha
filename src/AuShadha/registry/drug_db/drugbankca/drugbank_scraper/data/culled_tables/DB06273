It is also indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA) and active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) in patients 2 years of age and older.</td></tr><tr><th>Pharmacodynamics</th><td>A decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) was noted as early as week 2. Changes in pharmacodynamic parameters were observed (i.e., decreases in rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum amyloid A and increases in hemoglobin) with both doses, however the greatest improvements were observed with 8 mg per kg tocilizumab. Similar pharmacodynamic changes were also observed in active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients. </td></tr><tr><th>Mechanism of action</th><td>Interleukin (IL)-6 plays essential roles not only in the immune response, but also in haematopoiesis and the central nervous system. Deregulated production of IL-6 has been found in chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (soJIA), Crohn's disease (CD) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Furthermore, IL-6 activities can explain many symptoms of these diseases. More importantly, serum levels of IL-6 are correlated with disease activity. Tocilizumab binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R), and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors.</td></tr><tr><th>Absorption</th><td>When 4 mg/kg of tocilizumab was given every 4 weeks to RA patients, the pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state are as follows: 
AUC = 13000 &#177; 5800 mcg&#8729;h/mL;
Cmax = 88.3 &#177; 41.4 mcg/mL. 
Tocilizumab accumulates following repeated doses. Furthermore, an increased body weight may increase plasma levels of tocilizumab. 

When a dose of 8 mg/kg of tocilizumab is given to PJIA patients, the pharmacokinetic parameters are as follows:
AUC =  29500 &#177; 8660 mcg&#8729;h/mL;
Cmax = 182 &#177; 37 mcg/mL. 

When a dose of 8 mg/kg of tocilizumab is given to SJIA patients, the pharmacokinetic parameters are as follows:
AUC = 32200 &#177; 9960 mcg&#8729;h/mL;
Cmax = 245 &#177; 57.2 mcg/mL. 
</td></tr><tr><th>Volume of distribution</th><td><p>In rheumatoid arthritis patients the central volume of distribution was 3.5 L and the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.9 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 6.4 L.</p>
<p>In pediatric patients with <span class="caps">PJIA</span>, the central volume of distribution was 1.98 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.1 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 4.08 L.</p>
<p>In pediatric patients with <span class="caps">SJIA</span>, the central volume of distribution was 0.94 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 1.60 L resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 2.54 L.</p></td></tr><tr><th>Protein binding</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>Metabolism</th><td class="data-table-container"></td></tr><tr><th>Route of elimination</th><td>Following intravenous dosing, tocilizumab undergoes biphasic elimination from the circulation.</td></tr><tr><th>Half life</th><td>The half-life of tocilizumab is concentration-dependent. The concentration-dependent apparent half-life is up to 11 days for 4 mg/kg and up to 13 days for 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks in patients with RA at steady-state. The half-life in children with PJIA is up to 16 days. The half-life in pediatric patients with SJIA is up to 23 days.</td></tr><tr><th>Clearance</th><td><p>The clearance of tocilizumab decreases with increasing dose. At the 10 mg/kg single dose in RA patients, mean clearance was 0.29 &#177; 0.10 mL/hr/kg. The total clearance of tocilizumab is concentration-dependent and is the sum of the linear clearance and the nonlinear clearance. At low concentrations, concentration-dependent nonlinear clearance is dominant. At high concentrations, linear clearance dominates. The estimated linear clearances for specific patient populations are as follows:<br>
RA = 12.5 mL/h;<br>
<span class="caps">PJIA</span>, pediatric patients = 5.8 mL/h;<br>
<span class="caps">SJIA</span>, pediatric patients = 7.1 mL/h.</p></td></tr><tr><th>Toxicity</th><td>Most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 5%): upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension, increased ALT. </td></tr><tr><th>Affected organisms</th><td><ul><li>Humans and other mammals</li></ul></td></tr><tr><th>Pathways</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>SNP Mediated Effects</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>SNP Mediated Adverse Drug Reactions</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr id="pharmacoeconomics"><th class="divider" colspan="2">Pharmacoeconomics</th></tr><tr><th>Manufacturers</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>Packagers</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>Dosage forms</th><td class="data-table-container"><table class="table table-condensed table-striped datatable" id="dosages"><thead><tr><th>Form</th><th>Route</th><th>Strength</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Injection, solution, concentrate</td><td>Intravenous</td><td>80 mg/4 mL; 200 mg/10 mL; 400 mg/20 mL</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="interactions"><th class="divider" colspan="2">Interactions</th></tr><tr><th>Drug Interactions</th><td class="data-table-container"><table class="table table-condensed table-striped" id="experimental-properties"><thead><tr><th>Drug</th><th style="width: 75%"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="/drugs/DB00514">Dextromethorphan</a></td><td>Dextromethorphan is a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 substrate.
